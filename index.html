                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Greetings! I'm Oksana, though most of my students affectionately know me as Ms. Ana. My passion for education and special education has always been about helping young minds grow and develop. Since the beginning of my career, I've dedicated myself to creating fun and empowering experiences for children during their important early years. With my experience and excitement, I aim to build a nurturing environment where every child can succeed and reach their goals. Join me on this exciting journey as we shape the future.</p>

Everyone is welcome, regardless of their abilities! Looking forward to having fun and learning together!</p>
